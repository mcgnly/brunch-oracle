## Brunch-Oracle
#### get out of your Kiez


**purpose:**
I have a tendency to stay in the same 2 neighborhoods and go to the same 3 coffee shops in Berlin over and over again. This solves the cognitive-load aspect of having to search out a new place to try!

**current state:**
Currently, this project will recommend a random U- or S-Bahn station, which you can use as a starting point to find a new place to try

**future improvements:**
- given a transit stop, recommend a highly-rated breakfast, brunch, or coffee place
- give option to restrict results to places with vegan options

**usage:**
- this was made with python 3.6.0, but likely works with many versions
1. clone locally
2. run with ``` python brunch-suggestions.py```
